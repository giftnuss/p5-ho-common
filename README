HO stands for hierachical objects and is a small object oriented
library to create write only objects. Write only means it is not 
so easy and not really supported by the api to modify the structure 
of the created objects once after there placement inside the hierarchy.

Another drawback is that there is no builtin protection against
endless loops when a object is placed somewhere inside of himself.

One use case for this module anyway is the creation of template
files where this does not matter. There are some utility packages
HO::accessor and HO::class which may help to build up array
based objects.

This was a really long time project of mine, so that if the current
state is finished it is good enough to see light of review and usage.
Hope so.

It is free like all code should be, so use it in any way you like,
even ignoring it complete.

Thank you perl people for all the uncounted hours of happy coding.
